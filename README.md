## Python Script plugin, Emmet mod for new Notepad++ 7.6.4
***********************************************************************************

I am a big fan of Notepad++ text editor despite its' simple GUI. However, I noticed that it's hard to find any way to use code-completion plugins with newer version of Notepad++ due to the structural changes in the directories. So, I made some modifications and archived them in one zip package to make it easier for everyone to just extract and use the application.

#### Note
***********************************************************************************
I've added Emmet in this package. If you don't want to keep it, just delete the "Emmet" folder from /plugins directory.
