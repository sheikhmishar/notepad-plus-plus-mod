# Python Script plugin, Emmet mod for new Notepad++ 7.6.4
***********************************************************************************

I am a big fan of Notepad++ text editor despite its' simple GUI. However, I noticed in this thread [bruderstein/.../109](https://github.com/bruderstein/PythonScript/issues/109) that compatibilities of some useful plugins with newer version of Notepad++ were broken due to the structural changes in the directories. So, I made some modifications and archived them in one zip package to make it easier for everyone to just extract and use the application. 

### Download here: [Notepad++ Mod](https://github.com/sheikhmishar/notepad-plusNotepad++-plus-mod/blob/master/Notepad%2B%2B_7.6.4_x86_with_pyPreinstalled.zip)

#### Note
***********************************************************************************
I've added Emmet in this package. If you don't want to keep it, just delete the "Emmet" folder from /plugins directory.

#### Todo Next
***********************************************************************************
   Add more features
   Create minimal package
   Add more plugins
   Add more skins/themes

#### Special thanks go to "notepad-plus-plus" team and "bruderstein".
